      <description>This chapter covers very basic mathematical concepts. If you know how to work with vectors, you can skip this chapter. Vectors and Points To first understand how computer graphics work we need to unserstand how we can use our 3D-Space. Imagine you have a point in the space and you want to get to another. Your points always have three coordinates - \(x,y,z\). So you want to get from \((x_1,y_1,z_1)\) to \((x_2,y_2,z_2)\).</description>

      <description>In the last chapter we have covered basic concepts. For example, we can calculate vectors and now we want to move efficiently points with matrices. If you have not worked with matrices before, you can read about them more in detail here. Translation To easily move a vector we can use a translation matrix. The points are going to be moved by
$$\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{pmatrix}\to T = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; x_0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; y_0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; z_0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}$$Homogeneous coordinates You may have noticed that this is a matrix \(\in \Reals^4\) (i.</description>
